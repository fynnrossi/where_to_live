# Travel Search Tool

This is a **Flask-based web application** that helps users find optimal places to live based on their weekly travel locations and other filters. The tool calculates total travel times using a graph-based London transport network and suggests ideal locations to minimize travel.

## Features
- **Find optimal living locations** based on travel frequency to different places.
- **Calculate total weekly travel times** for different potential home locations.
- **Filter results** by max travel time, max distance from a location, and other constraints.
- **Interactive UI** for entering travel locations and visualizing results.
